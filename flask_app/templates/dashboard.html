                    As someone who often gets lost in work and forgets to eat as a result, I frequently experience hanger. It affects my
                    ability to think clearly and I begin to get snippy with the people around me. The real problem arises when deciding
                    where to eat. The longer it takes me to decide the more irritable I become!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is where the idea for Hangry was born. Here at Hangry, our mission isn't to find you a new amazing spot to eat.
                    We know that you need food, you need it fast, and you probably already have a few go-to spots nearby where you would
                    want to eat. This is where we come in to help! Instead of letting your jumbled, hanger-soaked mind attempt to figure out
                    where to eat as your hanger grows worse and worse by the second, we are here to quickly make that decision for you!

                        After receiving his bachelor's degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from Chapman University, Tommy changed gears and
                        began his career in software engineering. Now, as a fullstack developer and recent coding bootcamp graduate from Coding Dojo,
                        Tommy is excited about building solution based web applications such as Hangry. While building out web apps in his sparetime,
                        he is focused on landing a position as a developer where he can receive mentorship and learn as much as he can in order to
                        expand his horizons.

            <h3>Future of Hangry</h3>
            <p>
                Hangry's main functionality is built out but there are many other places to improve and develop. One new development to be implemented
                would be to provide a user with a new restaurant based on their location that many other users frequent. Ideally, in the distant future,
                Hangry will be able to incorporate minimal forms of machine learning and AI to give users new suggestions and to automatically add frequented
                restaurants to their favorites without the user having to manually input them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, in terms of front-end development, the app's look could use a facelift to make it more appealing and engaging to users rather than
                just focused on providing the bare bones structure to make Hangry function properly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, in regards to back-end development, much of the code can and should be revised to improve efficiency and decrease repeated work.
                Reworking the code would make it easier to maintain and update for future changes. The CSS and HTML could also be redesigned in a similar
                fashion to make it less repetitive and easier to update.
